            <div id="about"class="amtext">ABOUT ME<p class="p1">Hi there! My name is Lauren Echo and I'm a first year Design student at Massey University. As an outdoor enthusiast, my end goal is to use my design skills to bring awareness to environmental issues occuring in the world. Being a first year, I don't have much experience in the design world. That said, I've made quite a few logos and entered my work into design competitions. I've become quite proficient in Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, and InDesign. My goal is for my work to make a statement that a range of people can resonate with. </p></div>

            <div id="portfolio"class="stptext">SHRED THE PATRIARCHY<p class="p2">This logo was designed specifically for Coalition Snow. Coalition is an all women's ski and snowboard brand that challenges the status quo and promotes females getting outside. Beyond the outdoors, Coalition confronts more social issues that are plaguing our everyday lives. Their slogan that they wanted to redesign was "Shred the Patriarchy". This logo was meant to fuel the fire and make all women feel empowered. This is the first logo that I had ever designed and I loved the process because I resonate with the brand.</p></div>

            <div class="stptext">LIVE LIKE TATE<p class="p3">My Live Like Tate logo was made in remembrance of one of my greatest friends. He was pre-riding the Time Trial course when a car hit him. Tate didn't make it out alive, but my hope is that his legacy lives on. He lived every day like it was his last and always achieved what he wanted to. He decided he wanted to be a professional mountain biker, so he did. He then decided to be a professional road cyclist, so he made the difficult transition from mountain to road. If he didn't like doing something he just decided to love it more, so it would suck less. After knowing him for one hour, you felt that you had known him for years. This logo was made into stickers and conveys his passion for the outdoors while trying to make us remeber to Live Like Tate.</p></div>
